PiOmxTextures
=============
This is a proof of concept of how to build a QML Qt component that renders h264 1080p
video and audio using Raspberry Pi hardware decoder. Also contains code to hardware-decode
images to QML components.

In the omxplayeril_backend there is a QtMultimedia backend sample using PiOmxTextures as a shared
library.

In tools/POCPlayer there is a sample player used to test the backend.
